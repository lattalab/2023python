Programming Assignment #1 is due on March 14th, at 11:59pm.

It will be submitted through the cyberuniversity, and Lecture 3 will contain
slides at the end to discuss the upload procedure.

In this homework, you must follow the instructions, which only allows you to
use concepts taught in the first two lectures.

Attached to this posting are 4 files:
   AssignmentGuidelines.txt
   PA1expectedoutput.txt
   PA1template.py
   PA1description.txt

One of these files, "PA1description.txt", is a copy of the text you are now
reading.

Another of these files, "AssignmentGuidelines.txt", contains important rules
about doing assignments and submitting assignments. You should read it.
Also, this file is, in the present homework, being used as the input file.

Another of the files, "PA1expectedoutput.txt", shows you the expected output.
Your grade will be based on how well your output matches to this expected
output (and also on whether you followed any stated REQUIREMENTS for specific
code lines). In addition, to get a perfect score, your code will also need
to match to the TA's output after he modifies the input file.

The final final, "PA1template.py", is a template with certain areas that are
each indicated with a "...".  These are the areas that you need to replace
with your solutions. The comments above each these area discuss what the ...
should do. The comments also contain hints and requirements. It will be hard
to understand the "PA1template.py" file, unless you first print-out the
"PA1expectedoutput.txt" file and then compare the two files, line-by-line.
So for each "print" statement in "PA1template.py", try to locate what line(s)
of "PA1expectedoutput.txt" comes from that print.

Please start the assignment early, because some parts of the assignment are
not easy.
